<H2 align=center>HISTORY OF SYNTHESIZER</H2>
<H3>
The synthesizer concept is simple enough. A circuit generates a tone which is controlled and altered by an input. They can synthesize the sounds of instruments like pianos and guitars or generate more experimental electronic sounds. Synthesizers controlled through piano-like keyboards, sequencers, controllers fingerboards, guitar synthesizers and electronic drums are responsible for some of the most famous songs and movie soundtracks and they have made their mark on countless genres. Early synths Today, producers can open music software on their computers and recreate hundreds of synthesizers from the past 60 years. Even if you’ve never so much as seen a modular synth, you should understand where the sounds come from. The seeds of the modern electronic synthesizer were planted at the turn of the 19th century when an American inventor called Thaddeus Cahill applied for a patent to protect his idea for a Dynamophone. This steam-powered instrument was a giant, weighing more than 200 tonnes. It was played into the public telephone network because there was no such thing as a loudspeaker or public address system. It failed, perhaps, because it was ahead of its time. Created in 1919, the Theremin was much smaller and still enjoys something of a cult status today. Named after its Russian inventor, Leon Theremin, the monophonic instrument was played handsfree. The player would move and wave his arms between two antennae with an electrostatic field between them. The Theremin is famously difficult to play, but its eerie sound has found its way into dozens of horror movie soundtracks. A slight variation on the instrument called an electrotheremin is slightly easier to play and it was used to create the high-pitched sound in the Beach Boy’s 1966 hit Good Vibrations.
